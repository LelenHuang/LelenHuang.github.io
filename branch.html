            <h2>Life Insurance Branch</h2>
            <h3>Bank of Scotland</h3>
            <p>In 2018 Lloyds banking group decided to sell life insurance and critical illness cover in the branch.</p>
            <p>I was part of an ambitious project to design the branch experience starting with Bank of Scotland.</p>

            <div class="gap"></div>
            <h6>My Role</h6>
            <div class="gap2"></div>
            <p>I went through a long incubation period with the design team to understand customer problems and gain insights from our Banking Consultants, I then led design in one of the product teams working with PO and engineers to implement the experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fullrow">
            <h3>Customer Insights</h3>
            <p>The design team conducted serval rounds of customer interviews to understand their needs and pain points, then invited them into the office for co-creation exercises. We also used a quantitative survey to gain insights from 1000 potential customers.</p>

            <p>By using both quant and qual methods, we identified 10 customer problems and 3 customers types.</p>
          
            <div class="wide-image" style="background-image: url('img/customer_interview.jpg')"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="fullrow">
            <h3>Design Sprint & Ideation</h3>
            <p>We formed a team of representatives from every part of the business and ran a week long design sprint to come up with initial ideas to address the customer problems.</p>
            
            <div class="wide-image" style="background-image: url('img/Ideation.jpg')"></div>
        </div>


        <div class="fullrow">
            <h3>Co-creation with Banking Consultants</h3>
            <p>The Banking Consultants are crucial in the branch experience. We invited BCs from different branches in to be part of the design process. We interviewed them to understand their work environment and frustrations, and co-created solutions that can work for both customers and BCs.</p>
            
            <div class="wide-image" style="background-image: url('img/cocreationwithbc.jpeg')"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="fullrow">
            <h3>Experience Strategy & Vision</h3>
            <p>I created user flow and prototypes to share the vision with the business. This helped to evangelise ideas, gain alignment and drive decision making with stakeholders.</p>
         
            <div class="wide-image" style="background-image: url('img/lelenpresents.jpeg')"></div>
        </div>
  
        <div class="fullrow">
            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>To simulate the real branch experience, we went down to the testing centre in Manchester a few times. It was located inside a Lloyds bank, and set up same as branch environment. BCs tried to sell life insurance to the participants using the prototypes I produced.</p>
          
            <p>We made sure all stakeholders can either physically or remotely observe the sessions.</p>
           
            <div class="wide-image" style="background-image: url('img/branchusertesting.png')"></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="fullrow">
            <h3>Alignment and Iteration</h3>
            <p>Based on the Banking Consultant and customer feedback, all stakeholders were able to align on solutions. I then carried on to iterate the design. </p>
           
            <div class="wide-image" style="background-image: url('img/notes.jpeg')"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="fullrow">
            <h3>Final High-fidelity Design</h3>
            <p>I turned the agreed solution into high-fidelity designs, then collaborated with PO and developers to implement and deliver the product.</p>
          
            <div class="wide-image" style="background-image: url('img/BOSipads.jpg')"></div>
        </div>

            <h6>The approach</h6>
            <div class="gap2"></div>
            <p>1. Banking Consultants are not confident to sell products they are not familiar with, the right training has to be in place. The training team created training materials to address the issue.</p>

            <p>2. BCs have pressure to sell multiple products, there is too much information to remember. They need support information in their hands to show the customers. We designed soft facts, value points, product information and an A to Z tool on the landing page, so they can talk through this with the customers without any stress.</p>

            <p>3. There is always a way to introduce protection to the customer, but every BC uses a different conversation strategy. We learned to not design a fixed conversation framework, but provide them the right tool and information.</p>

            <p>4. With limited time in the appointment, BCs can only plant seeds and inform the customer. Protection is a serious decision, customers always do their research. BCs need to follow up with the customer, either continue the application in another appointment, through phone or point them to self-serve online. Omni-channel experience is the key.</p>
