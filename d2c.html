            <h2>Life Insurance D2C</h2>
            <h3>Halifax and Lloyds bank</h3>
            <p>Covid-19 lockdown started in March 2020, the company had to make a quick decision to change its protection strategy from branch to D2C. </p>

            <p>I was one of the lead designers helping to successfully turn things round.</p>
            <div class="gap"></div>

            <h6>10 Customer Problems</h6>
            <div class="gap2"></div>
            <p>From customer research, co-creation and user testing at the discovery phase, we defined 10 key customer problems. They helped the stakeholders to understand the experience we were aiming for and shaped the solution in the design phase.</p>
            <div class="gap"></div>
        </div>

            <h6>My Role</h6>
            <div class="gap2"></div>
            <p>I co-led the design of the Halifax MVP journey for two products teams between April 2020 and March 2021. After the launch of the MVP, I took the lead role to build Lloyds brand, design new features and optimise both journeys with the support of a user researcher, UX writer, data scientist and behavioural scientist.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fullrow-image">
            <h3>Customer Segments</h3>
            <p>I worked with other designers and researchers to understand our potential customers, their demographic and behavioural segmentation, and defined our targeted customer segments. We then collaborated with the marketing team to come up with strategies on how to reach out to these customers.</p>
          
            <div class="wide-image" style="background-image: url('img/customers.jpg')"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="fullrow-image">
            <h3>MVP Experience Strategy</h3>
            <p>The senior leadership thought we could quickly turn branch tablet journey into the mobile D2C journey. However, based on the customer research we knew that most people don't understand protection. We observed from the branch journey that customers constantly asked the Banking Consultant questions in the application process. Without the help of BC, the branch journey wouldn't work for D2C.</p>
            <p>I had to apply a user-centred approach to address the problems and design the right solutions. By bring all stakeholders into the design process, I aligned with the PO and senior leadership to define and deliver the MVP strategy in March 2021.</p>
            
            <div class="wide-image" style="background-image: url('img/iphones.jpg')"></div>
        </div>


        <div class="fullrow-image">
            <h3>Accessibility Strategy</h3>
            <p>The branch journey was designed with basic accessibility support because Banking Consultants can support most customer needs. In a self-served journey we need to make sure customers can complete the journey without human assistance.</p>

            <p>With a tight deadline ahead, the PO initially refused to do any accessibility work. I organised serval presentations and workshops to give all stakeholders an introduction to accessibility. Senior leadership realised that it would be a huge loss for the business if we don't serve 20% of our customers.</p>
      
            <p>With senior stakeholders' support, I worked with designers to redesign the journey, collaborated with engineers and QAs to explore automated testing tools, and established accessibility working process. .</p>
   
            <p>After delivering a AA standard accessible journey, I shared the learnings with the whole design community in Lloyds banking group. Some labs then invited me to speak on few more accessibility topics.</p>

        <div class="fullrow-image">
            <h3>Remote Customer Testing</h3>
            <p>With the restrictions of remote working, we had to conduct user testing on Teams. We couldn't capture participant's facial expression very well, but it made easy for the stakeholders to observe at home. I worked with a user researcher to define testing plans, and produced prototypes accordingly.</p>
         
            <div class="wide-image" style="background-image: url('img/remote testing.jpg')"></div>

        <div class="fullrow-image">
            <h3>Rebrand</h3>
            <p>To achieve the business goal, we needed to reach more customers. I rebranded the journey to Lloyds following brand guidelines. The product team finished implementation and launched to the Lloyds banking app in Sep 2021.</p>
          
            <p>I created a detailed style guide of the design system and worked with engineers to create a customisable component library. It allowed us to rebrand the Halifax journey to Lloyds easily. It will also be effortless for the engineers to rebrand Bank of Scotland journey later on.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="fullrow-image">
            <h3>Optimisation</h3>
            <p>Since the journey went live, I constantly work with Data Scientists to analyse the performance of the journey. I used data to map out the journey and identified the main drop-off points.</p>
        
            <p>To understand why customers drop off, I organised user testing sessions with our researcher. By observing customers going through the live journey, the team identified key problems.</p>
           
            <div class="wide-image" style="background-image: url('img/Test hypothesis.PNG')"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="fullrow-image">
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>I asked the stakeholders to come up with problem statements from their observations. We then agreed on the ones we want to bring forward for Ideation.</p>
           
            <p>With the support of other designers, I ran a couple of ideation sessions with a mixture of remote and in person participants and agreed on final ideas for further exploration. I later on produced prototypes, worked with the user researcher on customer testing and iteration.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="fullrow-image">
            <h3>Design New Features</h3>
            <p>We didn't manage to address all the customer problems in the MVP journey, so part of my job is to keep designing new features to solve these remaining problems. For example, we introduced save & retrieve to help customers return to the journey easily as we know "They do their research" and "Protection is a serious decision".</p>
          
            <div class="wide-image" style="background-image: url('img/S&R.jpg')"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="fullrow-image">
            <h3>Test & Learn</h3>
            <p>We used 2 brands to do A/B testing on some hypothesis. At end of 2021, I mapped all the hypothesis we tested in the live journey and validated if they make a positive impact. If things didn't work as expected, we can react quickly and find alternative solutions.</p>

            <h3>Planning & Scope definition</h3>
            <p>I used customer insights and impact effort matrix to help the PO and engineers to prioritise and define backlogs, so we can confidently meet both business and customer needs.
