            <h2>Digital Banking Platform</h2>
            <h3>NCR</h3>
            <p>NCR's digital banking platform is used by over 1000 banks and credit unions in the US. The platform enables banks to brand and create exceptional retail and business banking experiences on mobile and desktop, so they can reduce cost and focus on innovation.</p>
            <p>I was the lead UI/UX designer for business banking, and co-led design for retail banking.</p>

            <h6>The Challenge</h6>
            <div class="gap2"></div>
            <p>Our customers have customers</p>

            <p>Our direct customers are American banks and credit unions, they use our banking platform to create or manage banking apps. We need to create robust solutions for them to customise brand and manage features.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile their customers use our banking platform to do daily transactions and manage businesses. We don't hold any information or data on our customers' customers. This made it hard for us to understand customer problems.</p>

            <h6>My Role</h6>
            <div class="gap2"></div>
            <p>I worked closely with the Product Owners to optimise and deliver new features. I was also part of the design team to create the design system and component library.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fullrow-image">
            <h3>Design System & Component Library</h3>
            <p>I worked with other designers to create a flexible design system that can be customised to any brand, and support common used languages. With built in accessibility checking tool, our customers can be confident that their apps are accessible.</p>

            <p>I also conducted research to understand the needs of developers and designers, and improved our internal component library site.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="fullrow-image">
            <h3>Idea Exchange</h3>
            <p>I had regular calls with our customers to get their feedback, so we were able to improve their side of experience. However we couldn't reach out to their customers. To solve their problems, we launched an Idea Exchange channel. All customers can propose new ideas based on observations from their customers and data.</p>
            
            <div class="wide-image" style="background-image: url('img/ideaexchange.jpg')"></div>
        </div>


        <div class="fullrow-image">
            <h3>Customer Research</h3>
            <p>To validate the ideas and hypotheses, I worked closely with user researchers to recruit participants who bank with our customers. I produced prototypes for user testing and conducted survey with researchers.</p>
            
            <div class="wide-image" style="background-image: url('img/usertestingncr.png')"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="fullrow-image">
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>I regularly uncovered customer insights, and ideated with product teams and designers to make sure all stakeholders can align with the approach forward.</p>
         
            <div class="wide-image" style="background-image: url('img/ncrideation.jpeg')"></div>
        </div>
  
        <div class="fullrow-image">
            <h3>Final Experience</h3>
            <p>After the team defined and agreed on the solutions, I worked with POs and developers to translate concepts into features that address customer problems.</p>
           
            <div class="wide-image" style="background-image: url('img/DI feature.jpg')"></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="fullrow-image">
            <h3>Planning & Scope Definition</h3>
            <p>I created wireframes to visualise concepts and helped the POs and engineers to define backlogs by using customer insights and impact effort matrix.</p>

            <h6>UX Guilds & Talks</h6>
            <p>I ran weekly UX Guilds in Edinburgh office to help teams understand design thinking. I also spoke at internal and external conferences on various subjects.</p>
